Every time someone posts “We are hiring, hundreds of people apply with hope.
 Resumes. Comments. Messages. Prayers.

Most never hear back.
 No reply. No update. No closure.

A few days later, the same post appears again.
 Same words. Same false hope.
This isn’t networking.
 This isn’t branding.
 This is playing with the emotions of unemployed and struggling people, just for reach, likes, and visibility.

Job seekers are not engagement tools.
 Their hopes are not content.

If you’re not genuinely hiring, please don’t post that you are.
 A little honesty costs nothing.

 False hope costs someone’s peace.
Just something I felt needed to be said.
